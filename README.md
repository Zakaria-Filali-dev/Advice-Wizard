## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

throughout this project i started using the state logic and understand the best practices to implment it, also i made a good time going through some css concepts in a way of reminding me, and i made a good progress in dealing with jsx.


```js
    const deleteFavs = () => {
        setFav([])
    }

```

### Continued development

From now on am going to focus on the relations between components and minimize my margin of error in this section.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Frameworks_libraries/React_components) - This helped me understand the importance of following the family tree when it comes to components. I really liked the explaining pattern and will use it going forward.
